## Installation

To install the `@elizaos/plugin-specification` plugin, use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @elizaos/plugin-specification
```

or

```bash
yarn add @elizaos/plugin-specification
```

## Configuration

This plugin does not require any specific environment variables for configuration. However, you can define agents using the `Character` and `Agent` interfaces provided by ElizaOS.

### Example Configuration

Here’s an example of how to define a character using the `Character` interface:

```typescript
import { Character } from '@elizaos/plugin-specification';

const myCharacter: Character = {
  id: '12345',
  name: 'Eliza',
  username: 'eliza_bot',
  system: 'A friendly chatbot',
  bio: 'I am here to help you with your queries.',
  messageExamples: [
    ['Hello! How can I assist you today?'],
    ['What brings you here?'],
  ],
  topics: ['health', 'technology', 'lifestyle'],
  adjectives: ['friendly', 'helpful', 'knowledgeable'],
  knowledge: ['basic health tips', { path: 'tech/faq', shared: true }],
  plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-specification'],
  settings: {
    responseDelay: 1000,
  },
  secrets: {
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  },
  style: {
    all: ['polite', 'concise'],
    chat: ['casual'],
    post: ['formal'],
  },
};
```

## Usage Examples

Once you have defined your character, you can create an agent and interact with it. Here’s a simple example:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@elizaos/plugin-specification';

const myAgent: Agent = {
  ...myCharacter,
  enabled: true,
  status: 'active',
};

// Function to simulate a chat interaction
function chatWithAgent(agent: Agent, message: string) {
  if (agent.enabled) {
    console.log(`${agent.name}: ${agent.messageExamples[0][0]}`);
    // Here you would implement the logic to process the message and respond
  } else {
    console.log(`${agent.name} is currently disabled.`);
  }
}

// Simulating a chat
chatWithAgent(myAgent, 'Hello Eliza!');
```
